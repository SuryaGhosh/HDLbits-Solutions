These are my attempts to the problem set on https://hdlbits.01xz.net/. I primarly used the website to learn Verilog and practice digital design fundamentals. Feel free to see my attempts, and if you're using my solutions as a reference, then keep in mind that I may not be following best practices (I'm still a noob). I hope to continue this learning journey and begin to apply my skills to projects. :)
