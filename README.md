These are my attempts to the problem set on https://hdlbits.01xz.net/. I primarly used the website to learn Verilog and practice digital design fundamentals. Feel free to see my attempts, and if you're using my solutions as a reference, then keep in mind that I may not be following best practices. Something that I wish I had started early on when attempting these problems, was to use a simulation tool to help debug my code. I wanted to wait until after completing the problems before learning to use one, but looking back, I would have made much faster progress debugging with these tools rather than by hand. I am using ModelSim now, and it has made the learning process much more efficient - check it out if you're also banging your head trying to debug. Good luck to you, wherever you are in your (coding) journey, and I hope to continue my learning journey and begin to apply my skills to projects. :)
